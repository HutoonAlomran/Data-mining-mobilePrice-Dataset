# Estimate Phones Prices

<!-- introduction -->
## About The Project

Estimate the best prices for mobile phones for a mobile phone company. We performed data mining tasks such as clustering and classification. In clustering, we found the similarity to identifying distinct groups and what are the factors that affect estimating the price. In classification, the class attribute is the price_range This is the target variable with values of 0(low cost), 1(medium cost), 2(high cost), and 3(very high cost). The goal of the data mining tasks is to estimate the price of a mobile phone based on some set of specifications such as battery power, clock speed, Bluetooth, etcâ€¦
